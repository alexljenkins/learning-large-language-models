# Learning Large Language Models and Their Tools

The goal of this repo was to learn how to use the tools and systems of LLMs that have been
created with the release of ChatGPT.

## Learnings

The `learnings` directory contains simple examples of how to use a given package or tool, usually augmented from the docs.

- [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/starter_example.html) to generate embeddings and search for query context from your vectors.
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quickstart.html) to use pretrained models and a standardised interface.
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart) interfaces and integrations to models and tools.
- [Croma DB](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started) for an offline embedding database.
